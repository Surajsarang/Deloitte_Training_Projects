        <p>The story of the company is about harnessing the fruits of science for goals that go beyond business. We operate through two verticals - Basic Chemistry and Specialty Chemistry. The company’s Basic Chemistry product range provides key ingredients to many of the world's leading brands for glass, detergents, pharma, biscuit manufacturing, bakeries and other industries.

            We have the largest saltworks in Asia, and are the 3rd largest soda ash manufacturer and the 6th largest sodium bicarbonate manufacturer in the world.
            
            Our innovations in Specialty Chemistry have led to establishing Tata NQ -- India’s first and only nutritional science business. We have pioneered the production of Fossence and Gossence, a range of healthy prebiotic products which is marketed to B2B customers across India, North America, Europe, Middle East and Asia. The company has a strong position in the crop protection business through its subsidiary company Rallis India Ltd.
            
            Our green patented technology for manufacturing Highly Dispersible Silica is focused on delivering value addition to a number of industries, including high performance tyres, oral care, paints and additives, etc. In Energy Sciences, we are creating a platform to provide cutting-edge solutions around Lithium Ion cell technology.
            
            Our strength lies in science and our Innovation Centre at Pune is home to world-class R&D capabilities in nanotechnology and biotechnology. Our other innovation centres are located at Mithapur and Bengaluru.
            
            Sustainability as a practice is at the core of all of Tata Chemicals' activities, including our corporate social responsibility initiatives, and is intricately woven into all our business functions. In 2018, we set up the Centre of Excellence for Coastal and Marine Conservation, and the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture and Farm Excellence. Our vision is to be a leading sustainable chemicals solutions company serving customers through innovation and science.

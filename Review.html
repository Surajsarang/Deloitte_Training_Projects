            <p> <b>Vikram Story:</b> Following a series of<span itemprop="name" 
                style="color: rgb(99, 14, 108)"> murders of police officials,
                 a black ops cop goes after a mysterious gang of masked men, which 
                 has declared war on the system, which is protecting a fearsome drug lord.</span>

                <b>Vikram Review:</b> <span itemprop="name" 
                style="color: rgb(99, 14, 108)">Lokesh Kanagaraj</span> brings together the espionage-filled world
                 of Kamal Haasan’s 1986 film Vikram and his own 2019 film Kaithi’s action-filled
                  world of drug lords and cops in Vikram, a predictably plotted action film that
                   is more interested in expanding its universe without really immersing us into it.
                    It holds the mysteries of a spy film and provides the thrills of an action film 
                    to some extent, but it doesn’t feel wholly satisfactory and fails to leave us with 
                    the adrenaline rush that a film with such high ambitions promises.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Vikram works:</b> best in its first half, when we see Amar and his team trying to make 
                sense of the murders and track down the killers. Even though these portions have very 
                little of Kamal Haasan, we keep<span itemprop="name" 
                style="color: rgb(99, 14, 108)"> sensing his presence, both as the character and as the actor. 
                There are nods to Kamal’s oeuvre, from Nayakan to Anbe Sivam,<a and spotting them offers some 
                minor thrills. The actor, who is in action-star mode here, also gets a whistle-worthy moment,
                 which leads to the interval. And Vijay Sethupathi seems to be taking off from where he left in 
                 Master, playing a ruthless villain.
